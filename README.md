# Palmville
## Concept and Theme
This project is inspired by the option 2 of the assignment prompts. It is aimed at telling the life of the people living in a fictional community called PalmVille. This community is imagined to be high in palm trees and its surrounding is deserted. The PalmVille community is therefore a heaven, a sanctuary, and an oasis in this world. In this project, we imagine that at the end of the world, people are finding the final sanctuary of humanity, and that is PalmVille. To create this experience, we have made the website as the advertisement of this community, encouraging people to move here. The interactivity is displayed by clicking on the different residents to learn about their stories, scrolling effect, and the signup form.

The moral of the story: A heavenly community that seems to be nice, welcoming, and friendly. However, something seems to be not right here… (What is the secret behind the “no escape” rule?)


## Clips & Shot List
We have four scenes to shoot: The community environment for the introduction video, the sheriff’s interview, the restaurant owner’s interview, and the married couple’s interview. Here’s the primary shotlist of these clips:

## Implementation
### Audio


### Video
There are two parts of filming:1. Environment 2. Personal interviews. The equipment used in filming is the Sony video camera that comes with a microphone and the tripod. For the environment, we took shots in some spots on campus that might represent the imagined environment of PalmVille, including the Sexton Square, Highline, and the desert outside. We mainly took static scenes for around 30 seconds with some zoomed in shots.

## Roles and Contributions
### Diana
When working on the audio for the video, I wanted to sonically support the visuals that went along with the story of Palmville. While narrating the video, my goal was to convey a believable story for Palmville and help the audience feel as if they should live in Palmville. The main concept of the video was to advertise the small town, Palmville, which aims to grow its community over the next couple of years!
### Yupu
Primarily filmed the scenes, cut and edited the videos, helped build the website, and wrote the script and shot list together with other team members.
### Madina
### Kash
Worked on part of the script and shot list, helped film some of the scenes, and created the website.


## Reflection and Evaluations
### Diana
Brainstorming an idea took some time initially, but we were all able to agree on the final concept after the first class. We wanted to go for a light hearted pseudo-documentary that advertised the small town that we came up with known as Palmville. We based Palmville off of campus, since we knew that we needed to film primarily on campus. We then went on to pick different areas around campus to film and organized a final shot list. Once this was done, we each chose a character to write lines for and found actors to play each role. Over the following weeks, we shot footage of each character and collected our clips to prepare them for post production. Throughout the entire process, we communicated with each other to ensure the project was running smoothly and that each of us was fulfilling our roles. I really liked how our project came together in the end and enjoyed watching the final video.

Brainstorming with the team was really fun and when we came up with the idea for Palmville, I was very excited to see our project come to life. Creating a fictional place and story gave us the freedom to do pretty much anything we wanted to do, which is why we came up with funny ideas like the sheriff chasing someone, the chef singing to the trees, etc. Everything pretty much went according to plan and working with the team was great because everyone was enthusiastic about our idea. I had never filmed anything like this before so this was a great experience. Our shots came out pretty much how we expected them to, if not better. Creating the website also went really well because we had a rough design planned in our minds before starting. Overall, I think it’s safe to say that this project was a big success. We did more than we first thought we could, and it feels really good to see our hard work turn into something special.
